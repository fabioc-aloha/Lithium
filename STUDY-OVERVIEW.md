**Project**: Systematic Evidence Review and Meta-Analysis Framework  
**Principal Investigators**: Correa/Cohen/Deeble Family Research Team  
**Date**: February 5, 2026  
**Version**: 1.0

---

## 1. Study Goals

### Primary Goal

Evaluate the scientific evidence for lithium supplementation as a preventive intervention for Alzheimer's disease, with the long-term aim of designing a practitioner-based pilot study.

### Secondary Goals

1. Verify claims from popular science sources against peer-reviewed literature
2. Identify the optimal lithium formulation (carbonate vs. orotate)
3. Assess safety considerations for non-psychiatric elderly populations
4. Develop a framework for clinical implementation starting with a psychology practice pilot

### Implementation Goals (3-Phase)

| Phase | Setting | N | Objective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 | Wife's psychology practice | 20-30 | Feasibility pilot |
| Phase 2 | Multi-practitioner network | ≥100 | Effect size estimation |
| Phase 3 | Formal research collaboration | ≥300 | Statistical validation |

## 2. Research Questions

### Primary Question

> Is there sufficient scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that lithium supplementation can prevent or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease?

### Secondary Questions

1. **Mechanism**: How does lithium protect against neurodegeneration?
2. **Formulation**: Is lithium orotate superior to lithium carbonate for AD prevention?
3. **Dosing**: What is the optimal dose for neuroprotection vs. bipolar treatment?
4. **Safety**: What monitoring is required for low-dose lithium in the elderly?
5. **Translation**: What evidence gaps must be filled before clinical recommendation?

## 3. Hypotheses

| # | Hypothesis | Status | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H1 | Lithium has neuroprotective effects | ✅ Verified | HIGH |
| H2 | Brain lithium is reduced in AD patients | ✅ Verified | HIGH |
| H3 | Amyloid plaques sequester lithium | ✅ Verified | HIGH |
| H4 | Lithium orotate is superior to carbonate | ✅ Verified (mice) | MODERATE |
| H5 | Low-dose lithium slows cognitive decline | ✅ Verified | MODERATE |
| H6 | Lithium is safe at low doses in elderly | ✅ Verified | MODERATE |
| H7 | Clinical supplementation is warranted | ❌ Premature | LOW |

## 4. Literature Consensus

### Evidence Summary

| Category | Finding | Strength |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic science | Lithium inhibits GSK3β, reduces tau phosphorylation, protects synapses | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Animal models | Lithium orotate prevents and reverses AD pathology in mice | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Epidemiology | Higher environmental lithium → lower dementia rates | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| RCTs (positive) | 2 trials show cognitive stabilization with low-dose lithium | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| RCTs (negative) | 2 trials show no benefit (short duration, wrong outcome) | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Meta-analyses | 2/3 support benefit; 1 shows null result | ⭐⭐⭐ |

### Consensus Statement

> The hypothesis that lithium may prevent or slow Alzheimer's disease is **supported by converging evidence** from basic science, animal studies, and small human trials. However, **one meta-analysis (Huang 2024) found no significant association** in observational data, and **no lithium orotate trials exist in humans**. Clinical recommendation remains **premature** pending Phase 3 trials.

## 6. Key Findings

### What the Evidence Supports

1. ✅ Lithium is neuroprotective via GSK3β inhibition
2. ✅ Brain lithium levels correlate with cognitive preservation
3. ✅ Amyloid plaques trap lithium, creating local deficiency
4. ✅ Lithium orotate bypasses plaque sequestration (in mice)
5. ✅ Low-dose lithium stabilizes cognition in MCI (2 RCTs)
6. ✅ Low-dose lithium is safer than monoclonal antibodies

### What the Evidence Does NOT Support

1. ❌ Clinical recommendation for supplementation (no Phase 3 trials)
2. ❌ Specific dosing guidelines (unknown optimal dose)
3. ❌ OTC supplement use (unregulated quality)
4. ❌ Lithium orotate efficacy in humans (untested)

### Contradicting Evidence

- **Huang et al. 2024**: Meta-analysis of 377,060 subjects found **no significant association** between lithium use and dementia risk (OR=0.94, 95% CI 0.77-1.24)
- Possible explanations: observational study limitations, confounding by indication, dose variability

## 7. Future Directions

### Immediate Needs (Research Community)

| Priority | Action | Who |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Lithium orotate Phase 1 dose-finding | Yankner lab (planned) |
| 2 | LATTICE trial results publication | U Pittsburgh |
| 3 | Biomarker-guided RCT design | Academic centers |

### Our Study Directions

| Phase | Timeline | Milestones |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Preparation** | Now - Q2 2026 | Monitor LATTICE results, Yankner trial registration |
| **Protocol Development** | Q3 2026 | Design observational cohort, IRB consultation |
| **Phase 1 Pilot** | 2027 | N=20-30 in psychology practice, feasibility assessment |
| **Phase 2 Expansion** | 2028 | Multi-practitioner, effect size calculation |
| **Phase 3 Validation** | 2029+ | Formal RCT collaboration if Phase 2 positive |

### Critical Decision Points

1. **LATTICE Results** (expected 2026): If positive → accelerate our pilot planning
2. **Yankner Orotate Trial**: If registerd → consider orotate vs. carbonate for our study
3. **Phase 1 Pilot Completion**: If feasible → proceed to expansion; if not → reassess

---

## 8. Conclusion

### Bottom Line

The scientific rationale for lithium as an AD preventive is **strong and growing**. The 2025 Nature study provides the most compelling mechanistic evidence to date. However, translation to clinical practice requires:

1. **Human trials of lithium orotate** (the superior formulation)
2. **Longer-duration RCTs** (2+ years)
3. **Biomarker-validated endpoints**

### Recommendation

**Do not recommend lithium supplementation** to patients at this time. Continue monitoring the literature for:

- LATTICE trial results
- Yankner orotate trial registration
- Additional meta-analyses

When Phase 3 evidence becomes available, revisit this recommendation.
