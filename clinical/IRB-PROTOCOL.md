## 3. Study Synopsis

### 3.1 Background and Rationale

Recent research published in *Nature* (Aron et al., 2025) demonstrated that:
- Lithium is the only metal significantly reduced in the brains of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
- Amyloid plaques sequester lithium, creating local deficiency
- Lithium orotate, which evades plaque binding, reversed cognitive decline in mouse models

Prior randomized controlled trials (Forlenza et al., 2019; Nunes et al., 2013) showed that low-dose lithium carbonate stabilized cognition in individuals with MCI over 2-4 years. A network meta-analysis (Terao et al., 2024) found lithium comparable or superior to FDA-approved anti-amyloid antibodies.

This feasibility study aims to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary effects of low-dose lithium orotate supplementation in adults with subjective cognitive decline or early MCI.

### 3.2 Study Objectives

**Primary Objective:**
- Evaluate feasibility of recruiting, retaining, and following participants in a clinical psychology practice setting

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Assess safety and tolerability of low-dose lithium orotate
- Collect preliminary cognitive outcome data
- Establish protocols for multi-site expansion

### 3.3 Study Design

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Design | Open-label, single-arm, prospective observational study |
| Duration | 12 months |
| Sample Size | 20-30 participants |
| Setting | Single clinical psychology practice |
| Blinding | None (open-label) |

## 4. Study Population

### 4.1 Inclusion Criteria

1. Age ≥ 50 years
2. Subjective cognitive complaints (self or informant-reported) OR
3. MoCA score 22-26 (mild cognitive impairment range)
4. Adequate kidney function (eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73m²)
5. Normal thyroid function OR stable on thyroid replacement ≥ 3 months
6. Ability to provide informed consent
7. Willing to comply with study procedures
8. English-speaking (for cognitive assessments)

### 4.2 Exclusion Criteria

1. **Renal impairment**: eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m²
2. **Thyroid disease**: Uncontrolled or unstable thyroid condition
3. **Current lithium use**: Any form of lithium supplementation
4. **Established dementia**: Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia
5. **Mixed dementia**: Combined Alzheimer's and vascular dementia (per PI clinical judgment)
6. **Concurrent medications** (due to lithium interaction risk):
   - ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril, enalapril)
   - Angiotensin receptor blockers (e.g., losartan, valsartan)
   - Thiazide diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)
   - Loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide)
   - NSAIDs (chronic use; PRN use requires washout)
   - Potassium-sparing diuretics
7. **Pregnancy or planning pregnancy**
8. **Breastfeeding**
9. **Active substance use disorder**
10. **Unstable psychiatric condition** requiring medication adjustment
11. **Terminal illness** with life expectancy < 12 months
12. **Inability to swallow oral supplements**

### 4.3 Rationale for Mixed Dementia Exclusion

Clinical observation (Dr. Cohen, 2023) and mechanistic understanding suggest lithium's benefit is specific to amyloid-driven Alzheimer's pathology. Vascular dementia involves different pathophysiology (small vessel disease, microinfarcts) that lithium would not be expected to address.

## 7. Statistical Considerations

### 7.1 Sample Size Justification

This is a feasibility study. The sample size of 20-30 participants is based on:
- Practical recruitment capacity of a single practice
- Sufficient N to estimate feasibility metrics (recruitment, retention)
- Ability to detect common adverse events (≥ 10% incidence)

**Power calculation** is not applicable for feasibility studies. Efficacy outcomes are exploratory.

### 7.2 Planned Analyses

| Analysis | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Feasibility metrics | Descriptive statistics (proportions, 95% CI) |
| Safety | Incidence rates, severity grading |
| Cognitive change | Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank (pre/post) |
| Effect size | Cohen's d for cognitive outcomes |
| Subgroup analysis | By baseline MoCA category (exploratory) |

## 8. Risk Assessment

### 8.1 Known Risks of Lithium

| Risk | Likelihood at Study Dose | Mitigation |
|------|--------------------------|------------|
| Nephrotoxicity | Very low (dose is 1/100th of therapeutic) | Baseline and periodic eGFR monitoring |
| Hypothyroidism | Very low | Baseline and periodic TSH monitoring |
| GI upset | Low-moderate | Take with food; dose reduction if needed |
| Tremor | Very low | Dose reduction or discontinuation |
| Dehydration effects | Low | Education on hydration |
| Drug interactions | Moderate (if not screened) | Strict medication exclusion criteria |

### 8.2 Risk-Benefit Assessment

**Risks**: Low, given:
- Dose is ~1% of standard therapeutic dose
- Lithium orotate has lower ionic dissociation than carbonate
- Laboratory monitoring will detect early changes
- Strict exclusion of interacting medications

**Potential Benefits**:
- Possible cognitive stabilization (based on prior RCTs)
- Contribution to scientific knowledge
- Access to structured cognitive monitoring

**Conclusion**: The risk-benefit ratio is favorable for this population.
