## Pre-Screening Eligibility (Ask Before Scheduling)

### Quick Phone Screen

| Question | Required Answer | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Are you 50 or older? | ✅ Yes | Required |
| Do you have concerns about your memory? | ✅ Yes | Self or family |
| Have you been diagnosed with dementia? | ❌ No | MCI is OK |

## Medication Red Flags

### ⛔ STOP - Cannot Enroll If Taking:

| Medication Class | Common Examples | Reason |
|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **ACE Inhibitors** | lisinopril, enalapril, benazepril, ramipril | ↑ Lithium levels |
| **ARBs** | losartan, valsartan, olmesartan, irbesartan | ↑ Lithium levels |
| **Thiazide Diuretics** | hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), chlorthalidone | ↓ Lithium clearance |
| **Loop Diuretics** | furosemide (Lasix), bumetanide | ↓ Lithium clearance |
| **Potassium-Sparing Diuretics** | spironolactone, triamterene | Interaction |
| **Chronic NSAIDs** | ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve) daily | ↓ Lithium excretion |

### ⚠️ Caution - Discuss with Medical Director:

| Medication | Concern | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Metformin | Renal function | Check eGFR |
| Thyroid medications | Baseline dysfunction | Confirm stable ≥3 months |
| SSRIs/SNRIs | Serotonin syndrome (rare at low dose) | Usually OK, monitor |
| Antipsychotics | Additive neurological effects | Usually OK, monitor |
| Caffeine (high intake) | May reduce lithium levels | Counsel on consistency |

## Screening Visit Checklist

### ☑️ Before the Visit

- [ ] Confirm patient is 50+
- [ ] Confirm memory concerns exist
- [ ] Review current medications (no red flags)
- [ ] Have consent form ready
- [ ] Have MoCA materials ready

### ☑️ During the Visit

| Step | Done |
|------|------|
| 1. Explain study purpose and procedures | ☐ |
| 2. Review inclusion/exclusion criteria | ☐ |
| 3. Complete medication review | ☐ |
| 4. Administer MoCA | ☐ |
| 5. Record MoCA score: _____ / 30 | ☐ |
| 6. Order baseline labs (BMP, TSH) | ☐ |
| 7. Schedule baseline visit (after labs) | ☐ |

### ☑️ MoCA Interpretation

| Score | Interpretation | Study Eligibility |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| 26-30 | Normal | ✅ If subjective concerns |
| 22-25 | Mild cognitive impairment | ✅ Ideal candidate |
| 18-21 | Moderate impairment | ⚠️ Assess consent capacity |
| < 18 | Severe impairment | ❌ Exclude |

**Note**: Add 1 point if ≤12 years education

## Laboratory Requirements

### Baseline Labs (Required)

| Test | Why | Acceptable Range |
|------|-----|------------------|
| **BMP** (Basic Metabolic Panel) | Kidney function | eGFR > 60 |
| **TSH** | Thyroid function | 0.4 - 4.0 mIU/L |

### Where to Order

- [ ] Patient's PCP
- [ ] Quest Diagnostics
- [ ] LabCorp
- [ ] Other: ________________

### Lab Result Decision Tree

```
eGFR > 60?
├── YES → Continue
└── NO → EXCLUDE (kidney risk)

TSH 0.4-4.0?
├── YES → Continue
├── SLIGHTLY OFF + Stable on medication → Discuss with MD
└── CLEARLY ABNORMAL → EXCLUDE until treated
```

---

## Eligibility Decision Matrix

### ✅ ENROLL if ALL of the following:

- [ ] Age ≥ 50
- [ ] Subjective cognitive concerns present
- [ ] MoCA ≥ 22 (or ≥ 26 with concerns only)
- [ ] No dementia diagnosis
- [ ] No contraindicated medications
- [ ] eGFR > 60
- [ ] TSH normal (or stable on replacement)
- [ ] Signed informed consent

### ❌ EXCLUDE if ANY of the following:

| Exclusion | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| eGFR < 60 | Nephrotoxicity risk |
| Uncontrolled thyroid | Lithium affects thyroid |
| Taking ACE-i/ARB | Drug interaction |
| Taking diuretics | Drug interaction |
| Chronic NSAID use | Drug interaction |
| Dementia diagnosis | Too advanced; prevention study |
| Mixed dementia | Vascular component won't respond |
| Cannot consent | Ethical requirement |
| Pregnant/breastfeeding | Teratogenicity |

## Common Questions from Patients

### "Is lithium safe?"

> "At the dose we're using—about 1/100th of what's prescribed for bipolar disorder—the safety profile is excellent. We'll still monitor your kidney and thyroid function every 3 months to be sure."

### "Will I need blood tests?"

> "Yes, we'll check kidney and thyroid function before you start and every 3 months during the study. This is a safety precaution."

### "Is this the same lithium used for bipolar disorder?"

> "It's the same element, but a different form and much lower dose. We're using lithium orotate, which is available as a supplement. The dose is tiny compared to psychiatric treatment."

### "When will I know if it's working?"

> "This is primarily a safety and feasibility study. Any cognitive benefits would likely take months to appear. We'll track your memory tests throughout the year."

### "What if I have side effects?"

> "The most common side effect is mild stomach upset, which usually improves if you take it with food. If you experience any problems, call us right away and we can adjust or stop the supplement."
