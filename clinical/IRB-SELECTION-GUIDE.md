## Lahai Health — Lithium Orotate for Cognitive Protection Study

**Protocol**: LAHAI-LI-2026-001
**Last Updated**: February 5, 2026
**Status**: ⚠️ DECISION REQUIRED

---

## Executive Summary

**Lahai Health does not have an internal Institutional Review Board (IRB).** All human subjects research conducted under Lahai's sponsorship must be reviewed and approved by an external IRB before participant enrollment can begin.

This document evaluates IRB options and provides a recommendation for the Phase 1 Lithium Orotate study.

---

## Why an IRB Is Required

1. **Federal Regulations**: The Common Rule (45 CFR 46) requires IRB review for human subjects research
2. **Ethical Obligation**: Independent ethics review protects participants and researchers
3. **Publication Requirement**: Peer-reviewed journals require IRB approval documentation
4. **Grant Eligibility**: NIH and most foundations require IRB approval for funding
5. **Liability Protection**: IRB oversight provides legal protection for the organization

## Study Classification

Before selecting an IRB, understand how our study will be classified:

| Factor | Our Study | Implication |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Product Type** | Dietary supplement (not drug) | No FDA IND required |
| **Risk Level** | Minimal risk | May qualify for expedited review |
| **Population** | Adults 50+, cognitively intact to mild impairment | Not a vulnerable population |
| **Procedures** | Cognitive testing, blood draws, questionnaires | Standard clinical procedures |
| **Duration** | 12 months | Annual continuing review required |

**Expected Review Type**: Expedited (not full board) — faster and lower cost

## Recommendation

### For Phase 1 Feasibility Study: **Sterling IRB**

**Rationale**:
1. **Cost-effective**: $1,500-2,500 initial + ~$750/year continuing = ~$3,000 total for 12-month study
2. **Fast turnaround**: 2-3 weeks supports March 2026 submission timeline
3. **Appropriate scale**: Right-sized for a 20-30 participant pilot study
4. **Supplement experience**: Familiar with dietary supplement protocols
5. **Professional service**: Dedicated support without premium pricing

### For Future Phase 2/3 Studies: **Consider Advarra or WCG**

If Phase 1 succeeds and larger multi-site trials are planned, transitioning to a larger IRB like Advarra or WCG would provide:
- Multi-site coordination capabilities
- Greater name recognition for publications
- Established relationships for faster reviews

### Alternative Worth Exploring: **Verdant Health Commission**

Given Verdant's existing relationship with Lahai and their role as a hospital district, inquire whether they have:
- Internal IRB services
- Partnerships with hospital IRBs (Swedish, Providence)
- Willingness to sponsor research oversight
