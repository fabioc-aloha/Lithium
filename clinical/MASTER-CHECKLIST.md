### 3.2 IRB Options to Evaluate

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Lahai Health does not have an internal IRB. An external IRB must be selected and budgeted before the study can proceed. This is a **critical path item**.
>
> 📄 **See**: [IRB-SELECTION-GUIDE.md](IRB-SELECTION-GUIDE.md) for detailed comparison, costs, timeline, and recommendation.

#### Recommended: Commercial/Independent IRBs

For a Phase 1 feasibility study with supplements (not drugs), commercial IRBs offer the fastest path:

| IRB | Estimated Cost | Timeline | Notes |
|-----|----------------|----------|-------|
| [Sterling IRB](https://www.sterlingirb.com/) | $1,500-3,000 | 2-3 weeks | **Recommended** - Budget-friendly, experienced with supplement studies |
| [Solutions IRB](https://www.solutionsirb.com/) | $1,000-2,500 | 2-3 weeks | Budget-friendly option |
| [Advarra](https://www.advarra.com/) | $2,000-4,000 | 2-4 weeks | Common for academic spinoffs |
| [WCG IRB](https://www.wcgirb.com/) | $2,500-5,000 | 2-4 weeks | Largest commercial IRB |

#### Alternative: Academic Partnership

| Option | Approach | Timeline | Notes |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| University of Washington | Partner with faculty co-investigator | 4-8 weeks | Adds academic credibility, lower cost |
| Seattle Pacific University | Affiliation agreement | 4-6 weeks | Local option |

#### Other Options to Explore

| Option | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Verdant Health Commission** | As a hospital district, may have IRB access or partnerships |
| **Swedish/Providence Health** | Sometimes review community studies |
| **Washington State WIRB** | State relationships with Western IRB |

#### Budget Recommendation

- Add **$2,000-3,000** to Phase 1 budget for IRB fees
- Add **4-6 weeks** to project timeline for IRB review and approval
- Total IRB timeline: Submit March 2026 → Approval April-May 2026
