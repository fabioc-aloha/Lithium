**Study Title**: Low-Dose Lithium Orotate Supplementation for Cognitive Protection in Adults with Subjective Cognitive Decline: A Single-Site Feasibility Study

**Protocol Number**: LAHAI-LI-2026-001

**Sponsor**: Lahai Health

**Principal Investigator**: Claudia Correa, Counselor

## Introduction

You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide whether to participate, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.

## Why Is This Study Being Done?

Recent scientific research suggests that **lithium**, a natural element found in trace amounts in drinking water and food, may help protect brain function as we age. A major study published in 2025 found that people with early memory problems have lower lithium levels in their brains.

This study aims to find out:
1. Whether it is **practical** to offer lithium supplementation in a counseling practice setting
2. Whether low-dose lithium orotate is **safe and well-tolerated** in adults with memory concerns
3. Whether there are any **early signs of benefit** for memory and thinking

---

## Why Have I Been Invited?

You have been invited because:
- You are 50 years of age or older
- You have expressed concerns about your memory or thinking, OR
- You scored in the "mild impairment" range on a cognitive screening test
- You do not have conditions that would make lithium unsafe for you

About **20-30 people** will participate in this study.

---

## Do I Have to Take Part?

**No.** Participation is completely voluntary. If you decide to take part, you are free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason. This will not affect the care you receive from your counselor or any other healthcare provider.

---

## What Will Happen If I Take Part?

If you agree to participate:

### Screening Visit (Visit 1)
- We will review your medical history and medications
- You will complete a brief memory test (takes about 10 minutes)
- We will order blood tests to check your kidney and thyroid function

### Baseline Visit (Visit 2)
- We will review your blood test results to confirm you can safely participate
- You will complete additional memory and mood questionnaires
- You will receive a 3-month supply of lithium orotate supplements
- We will explain how to take the supplement

### During the Study (12 Months)
- You will take **one lithium orotate supplement daily** with food
- You will have **4 in-person visits** (baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months)
- You will receive **2 phone check-ins** (1 month, 9 months)
- Blood tests will be done at 3, 6, and 12 months

### What Tests Will Be Done?

| Test | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Memory tests (MoCA, MMSE) | Track cognitive function | Baseline, months 3, 6, 12 |
| Blood tests (kidney, thyroid) | Monitor safety | Baseline, months 3, 6, 12 |
| Questionnaires (mood, quality of life) | Overall wellbeing | Baseline, 6, 12 months |

## What Is Lithium Orotate?

Lithium orotate is a **dietary supplement** containing a small amount of lithium bound to orotic acid. It is:
- Available over-the-counter without a prescription
- Different from prescription lithium (lithium carbonate) used for bipolar disorder
- Contains about **1/100th** the amount of lithium used in psychiatric treatment

Lithium is a naturally occurring element. Some drinking water sources contain lithium, and studies have found that people in areas with higher water lithium have lower rates of dementia.

## What Are the Possible Risks?

### Likely Risks (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)
- **Mild stomach upset**: Nausea, mild diarrhea (usually improves with food)

### Less Likely Risks (may affect 1-10 in 100 people)
- **Thirst or dry mouth**
- **Mild tremor (shakiness)**
- **Slight weight changes**

### Rare Risks (affect fewer than 1 in 100 people)
At the low dose used in this study, these are very unlikely but possible:
- **Kidney function changes**: We will monitor with blood tests
- **Thyroid function changes**: We will monitor with blood tests
- **Worsening of tremor or muscle weakness**

### Drug Interactions
Lithium can interact with certain medications. You **cannot participate** if you take:
- Blood pressure medications called ACE inhibitors or ARBs (e.g., lisinopril, losartan)
- Water pills (diuretics) such as hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide
- Regular use of ibuprofen, naproxen, or other NSAIDs

### Pregnancy Risk
Lithium may harm an unborn baby. **Do not participate if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.** Use effective contraception if applicable.

---

## What Are the Possible Benefits?

We cannot guarantee any direct benefit to you. However:
- Some prior studies have shown that lithium may help **stabilize memory** in people with early cognitive changes
- You will receive **regular cognitive monitoring** that may detect changes early
- Your participation will help us learn whether this approach is worth studying further
