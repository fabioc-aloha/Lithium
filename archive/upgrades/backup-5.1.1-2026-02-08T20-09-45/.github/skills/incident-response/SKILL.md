## Severity Levels

## Response Phases

**Detect** → **Triage** → **Resolve** → **Review**

## Triage Questions

2. How many affected?
3. Workaround exists?
4. Who owns this?
5. Severity level?

## Resolve Decision

| Need investigation? | Enable debug logging, check recent changes |

## Communication

| Audience | Content |
| -------- | ------- |
| Users | Status, ETA |
| Leadership | Impact summary |
| Team | Technical details |
