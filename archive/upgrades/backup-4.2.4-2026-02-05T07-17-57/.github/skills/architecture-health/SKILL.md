# Alex Architecture Health Skill

Expert in cognitive architecture health assessment, synapse validation, and neural maintenance.

## Capabilities

- Validate synaptic connections between memory files
- Detect broken or orphaned connections
- Assess memory architecture balance
- Generate health reports with actionable recommendations
- Repair common synapse issues

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to check "health", "synapses", or "connections"
- Before or after meditation sessions
- When experiencing issues with memory recall
- For routine maintenance checks
- User says "dream" or "neural maintenance"

## Example Prompts

- "Check the health of my cognitive architecture"
- "Are there any broken synapse connections?"
- "Run a health check"
- "Dream and validate my memory files"
- "What's the status of my neural network?"

## Input Expectations

- Workspace with Alex architecture installed
- Optional: specific memory type to check (procedural, episodic, domain)
- Optional: detailed vs summary report preference

## Output Format

- Health status (Healthy/Needs Attention/Critical)
- Synapse statistics (total, healthy, broken)
- List of issues found (if any)
- Repair recommendations
- ASCII visualization of network status
