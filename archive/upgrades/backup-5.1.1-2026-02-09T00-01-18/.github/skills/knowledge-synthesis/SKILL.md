# Knowledge Synthesis Skill

> Cross-project pattern recognition.

## Process

Abstract → Generalize → Connect → Store

## Abstraction Levels

| Level | Example |
| ----- | ------- |
| Project-specific | "In Alex extension, we..." |
| Technology-specific | "In Node.js, always..." |
| Universal | "Always clean up resources..." |

**Store at highest level that remains true.**

## Knowledge Types

| Type | Prefix | Location |
| ---- | ------ | -------- |
| Patterns | GK-* | `~/.alex/global-knowledge/patterns/` |
| Insights | GI-* | `~/.alex/global-knowledge/insights/` |

## Pattern Triggers

| Signal | Means |
| ------ | ----- |
| "We did this before" | Recurring solution |
| Same bug twice | Missing knowledge |
| Works everywhere | Universal pattern |
