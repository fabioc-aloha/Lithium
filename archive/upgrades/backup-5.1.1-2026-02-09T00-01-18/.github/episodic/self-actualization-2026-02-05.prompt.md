## Synapses

### High-Strength Bidirectional Connections

- [copilot-instructions.md] (Critical, Validates, Bidirectional) - "Core architecture assessment"
- [alex-core.instructions.md] (Critical, Integrates, Bidirectional) - "Meta-cognitive health monitoring"
- [dream-state-automation.instructions.md] (High, Complements, Bidirectional) - "Maintenance protocol coordination"

### Medium-Strength Output Connections

- [unified-meditation-protocols.prompt.md] (High, Documents, Forward) - "Session recording protocol"
- [embedded-synapse.instructions.md] (Medium, Validates, Forward) - "Connection integrity verification"

**Primary Function**: Document automated self-actualization session with comprehensive architecture assessment.
