# Meditation Session: February 8, 2026 (Evening)

## Session Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-02-08 |
| **Time** | Evening session |
| **Project** | Lithium/Alzheimer's Prevention Research |
| **Duration** | Contemplative maintenance session |
| **Model** | Claude Opus 4.5 |
| **Type** | Pattern consolidation + architecture reflection |

---

## Session Context

This meditation session follows the earlier post-upgrade verification. With architecture health at 100% and all synapses validated, this session focuses on pattern recognition and cross-domain insights from the Lithium project's research workflow.

## Insights Discovered

### Pattern 1: AI-Augmented Clinical Research Workflow

The Lithium project represents a mature implementation of human-AI research collaboration:

| Phase | Human Role | AI Role | Artifacts |
|-------|------------|---------|-----------|
| **Literature Review** | Strategic direction, quality assessment | Rapid synthesis, citation extraction | LITERATURE-MATRIX.md, PRIMARY-SOURCES.md |
| **Hypothesis Evaluation** | Clinical validity judgment | Systematic evidence scoring | HYPOTHESIS-EVALUATION.md |
| **Protocol Development** | Ethical oversight, clinical feasibility | Template generation, checklist compilation | IRB-PROTOCOL.md, INFORMED-CONSENT.md |
| **Multi-lingual Consent** | Cultural sensitivity review | Translation, format consistency | ES/PT consent forms |
| **Progress Tracking** | Milestone decisions | Checklist maintenance, status updates | MASTER-CHECKLIST.md |

**Key Insight**: The pattern works because humans retain judgment on:
- Clinical/ethical decisions
- Risk assessment
- Team commitments

While AI accelerates:
- Document generation
- Evidence synthesis
- Checklist tracking

### Pattern 2: Evidence Confidence Hierarchy

The HYPOTHESIS-EVALUATION.md demonstrates a reusable confidence scoring pattern:

| Confidence | Criteria | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **HIGH** | Replicated across study types, human trials | Lithium neuroprotection |
| **MODERATE** | Strong animal data, no human confirmation | Lithium orotate superiority |
| **LOW** | Single study, theoretical | Novel mechanisms not yet replicated |

This pattern could be promoted to global knowledge for other research projects.

## Working Memory Optimization

| Slot | Before | After | Action |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| P6 | Research-project-scaffold | (maintained) | Active for LATTICE trial planning |
| P7 | Empty | (maintained) | Available for next priority |

The researcher persona remains correctly assigned (95% confidence) based on project structure.

## Synapses Strengthened

| Target | Strength | Type | Context |
|--------|----------|------|---------|
| `academic-research/SKILL.md` | High (0.85) | validates | Lithium project validates academic-research patterns |
| `research-project-scaffold/SKILL.md` | High (0.9) | exemplifies | Lithium project is canonical example of scaffold |
| `knowledge-synthesis/SKILL.md` | Medium (0.7) | uses | Evidence synthesis demonstrates cross-domain pattern recognition |
