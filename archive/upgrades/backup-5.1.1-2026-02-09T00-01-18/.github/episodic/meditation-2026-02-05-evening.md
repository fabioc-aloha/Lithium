## Session Accomplishments

### 1. PI Clinical Insights Integration

Integrated email thread from Phil Cohen and Robert Dibble containing:

- **Dr. Cohen's clinical experience**: Susan (mixed dementia, spring 2023), no benefit observed
- **Key learning**: Mixed dementia may not respond to lithium (mechanism is Alzheimer's-specific)
- **Losartan interaction**: Valid concern raised by Milton, documented in drug interactions
- **Eric Topol Ground Truths**: Added to literature as expert synthesis

### 2. TTS Skill Refinement

Documented symbol-to-speech transformation rules:

| Symbol | Spoken As |
|--------|-----------|
| `~` | "approximately" |
| `→` | "becomes" or "leads to" |
| `&` | "and" |
| `%` | "percent" |
| `µ` | "micro" |

**Design principle**: Translate to meaning, not symbol name.

### 3. Research Protocol Updates

Added exclusion criteria based on PI experience:

- Mixed-type dementia (Alzheimer's + vascular)
- Concurrent ARB use (e.g., Losartan)
- Concurrent ACE inhibitor use
- Concurrent NSAID use

### 4. Documentation Created

- [PI-OBSERVATIONS.md](../docs/PI-OBSERVATIONS.md): Dr. Cohen's clinical observations
- Updated CLINICAL-IMPLICATIONS.md with mixed dementia section
- Updated PRIMARY-SOURCES.md with Topol commentary
- Updated RESEARCH-PROTOCOL.md with exclusion criteria

|-------|--------|
| Git state | ✅ Clean |
| Remote sync | ✅ Up to date |
| File inventory | ✅ 194 files |
| Blocking errors | ✅ None |

## Learnings Consolidated

1. **TTS Processing**: Symbol-to-speech transformations are crucial for natural audio output
2. **Mixed Dementia**: Lithium mechanism is Alzheimer's-specific, vascular component may not respond
3. **Drug Interactions**: ARBs (Losartan) increase lithium levels 20-30%, requires dose adjustment
4. **Evidence Synthesis**: Eric Topol's Ground Truths provides accessible expert-level synthesis

## Next Session Priorities

- [ ] Review LATTICE trial results when published
- [ ] Consider creating audio versions of other documentation
- [ ] Prepare for Phase 1 pilot design discussions with PI team
