## Knowledge Consolidated

### Pattern Discovered: Post-Upgrade Verification Protocol

Upgrade validation follows a consistent checklist:
1. Manifest version check
2. Skill count comparison (should be same or greater)
3. Episodic memory preservation verification
4. Global knowledge integrity check
5. User profile preservation

This pattern was documented in [heir-skill-promotion.instructions.md](../instructions/heir-skill-promotion.instructions.md).
