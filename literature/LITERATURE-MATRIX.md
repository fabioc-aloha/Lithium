## Part 5: Evidence Quality Matrix

### GRADE Assessment

| Evidence Type | Studies | Quality | Limitations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Basic Science | Nature 2025 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Single study (albeit comprehensive) |
| Animal Models | Nature 2025 + preclinical | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Mouse models may not translate |
| RCTs (positive) | 2 (Nunes, Forlenza) | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | Small N, single-site |
| RCTs (negative) | 2 (Hampel, Devanand) | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | Short duration (10-12 wks) |
| Meta-analyses (positive) | 2 (Matsunaga, Terao) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mod-High | Limited trials pooled |
| **Meta-analysis (null)** | 1 (Huang 2024) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mod-High | **Observational only; contradicts RCTs** |
| Epidemiological | 3 studies | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mod-High | Cannot prove causation |

### Consistency Analysis

| Hypothesis | Basic Science | Animal | RCT | Epi | Meta | Overall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Li is neuroprotective | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚖️ | Strong |
| Li prevents AD | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚖️ | Moderate |
| Li orotate > carbonate | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — | Preliminary |
| Clinical recommendation | — | — | ❌ | — | — | Premature |

## Part 6: Gap Analysis

### Evidence Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Resolution Needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No lithium orotate human trials | Cannot validate Nature 2025 findings | Yankner planned trial |
| No Phase 3 RCTs | Insufficient for FDA approval | Large multi-site RCT |
| Contradicting meta-analysis | Weakens observational evidence | More RCTs needed |
| No dose-finding studies | Unknown optimal dose | PK/PD study |
| Limited elderly safety data | Risk assessment incomplete | Long-term safety study |

### Active Research Needs

| Priority | Research Question | Study Type Needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What is optimal lithium orotate dose for neuroprotection? | Phase 1/2 PK study |
| 2 | Does lithium orotate prevent conversion from MCI to AD? | Phase 2/3 RCT |
| 3 | Is biomarker response (p-tau217) predictive of clinical benefit? | Mechanistic RCT |
| 4 | What is long-term safety in non-psychiatric elderly? | Registry study |
