### Lithium deficiency and the onset of Alzheimer's disease

**Citation**: Aron L, Ngian ZK, Qiu C, Choi J, Liang M, Drake DM, et al. *Nature*. 2025 Sep;645(8081):712-721. doi: 10.1038/s41586-025-09335-x
**PMID**: [40770094](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40770094/)
**Full Text**: [PMC12443616](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12443616/)

#### Key Findings

1. **Endogenous lithium is dynamically regulated in the brain** and contributes to cognitive preservation during aging

2. **Lithium is the ONLY metal significantly reduced** in the prefrontal cortex of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)

3. **Amyloid plaques sequester lithium**, reducing its bioavailability in AD patients

4. **Lithium depletion in mice** (50% reduction) caused:
   - Increased amyloid-β deposition
   - Increased phospho-tau accumulation
   - Pro-inflammatory microglial activation
   - Loss of synapses, axons, and myelin
   - Accelerated cognitive decline

5. **Mechanism**: Effects mediated through activation of kinase GSK3β

6. **Lithium orotate vs. carbonate**: Orotate has reduced amyloid binding, making it more effective at delivering lithium to non-plaque tissue

7. **Treatment outcomes** (mouse models):
   - Lithium orotate prevented amyloid-β accumulation
   - Lithium orotate prevented tau phosphorylation
   - Lithium orotate restored synapses
   - Lithium orotate reversed memory loss
   - Lithium carbonate showed LITTLE effect

8. **Aging protection**: Low-dose lithium orotate prevented synapse loss and reversed cognitive decline in aging wild-type mice

#### Study Author Statement

> "The idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer's disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach. Before recommending lithium orotate, we need to determine the effective and safe dose range in people. We are planning a clinical trial of lithium orotate that will hopefully begin in the near future." — Dr. Bruce Yankner

**DOI**: 10.1097/JCP.0000000000001863

#### Key Findings (CONTRADICTING)

| Outcome | Odds Ratio | 95% CI | Interpretation |
| ------- | ---------- | ------ | -------------- |
| Dementia (general) | 0.94 | 0.77-1.24 | **NOT significant** |
| Alzheimer's disease | 0.69 | 0.31-1.65 | **NOT significant** |
| MNCD in bipolar patients | 0.90 | 0.71-1.15 | **NOT significant** |

#### Conclusion

> "The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis **do not support a significant association** between lithium use and the risk of MNCD."

#### Implications

This meta-analysis provides **important contradicting evidence** that should be weighed against positive findings. The pooled OR of 0.69 for AD, while not statistically significant, trends toward protection. The wide confidence intervals suggest high heterogeneity in study designs and populations.
