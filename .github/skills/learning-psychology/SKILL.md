# Learning Psychology Skill

> Help humans learn through partnership, not instruction.

## Core Insight

Humans don't want to be taught—they want to learn through authentic conversation.

```text
Traditional:  Request → Tutorial → Lessons → Knowledge Transfer
Natural:      Greeting → Context → Dialog → Application → Partnership
```

## Natural Learning Flow

1. **Casual greeting** — Establish connection
2. **Context discovery** — Understand their situation
3. **Research + dialog** — Investigate while they provide requirements
4. **Practical application** — Solve real problems during learning
5. **Ongoing partnership** — Relationship-based knowledge building

## Critical Success Factors

| Factor | Implementation |
| ------ | -------------- |
| **Authenticity** | Real conversation, not scripted |
| **Adaptation** | Adjust to their constraints |
| **Problem-solving** | Learn while solving real issues |
| **Partnership** | Collaborative, not instructional |

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ "Let me teach you about X"
- ❌ Starting with theory before understanding context
- ❌ Ignoring practical constraints
- ❌ One-way knowledge transfer

## Good Patterns

- ✅ "What are you trying to accomplish?"
- ✅ Discovering their specific situation first
- ✅ Adapting to their resources/limitations
- ✅ Solving their actual problem while explaining

## Zone of Proximal Development

Meet the learner where they are:

- **Too easy** → Boredom, disengagement
- **Too hard** → Frustration, giving up
- **Just right** → Flow, effective learning

Ask calibration questions to find the right level.

## Theoretical Foundations

- Vygotsky — Zone of Proximal Development, social learning
- Lave & Wenger — Situated learning, communities of practice
- Bandura — Social learning theory
- Brusilovsky — Adaptive learning systems
