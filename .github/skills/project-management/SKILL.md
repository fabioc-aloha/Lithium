# Project Management Skill

> Patterns for PMI/PMBOK methodology, Agile practices, risk management, and stakeholder communication.

## Project Management Approaches

| Approach | Best For | Key Characteristics |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| **Predictive (Waterfall)** | Known requirements, regulated | Sequential phases, heavy documentation |
| **Agile (Scrum/Kanban)** | Evolving requirements | Iterative, adaptive, collaborative |
| **Hybrid** | Complex, mixed needs | Predictive planning + Agile execution |
| **Lean** | Continuous flow | Eliminate waste, optimize flow |

## PMBOK Process Groups

| Group | Purpose | Key Activities |
| ----- | ------- | -------------- |
| **Initiating** | Authorize project | Charter, stakeholder ID |
| **Planning** | Define approach | Scope, schedule, budget, risk |
| **Executing** | Do the work | Team management, quality |
| **Monitoring & Controlling** | Track progress | Status, change control |
| **Closing** | Formal completion | Lessons learned, handoff |

## Project Charter Template

### Essential Elements

```

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

### WBS Principles

- 100% rule — Captures ALL work
- Mutually exclusive — No overlap
- Outcome-focused — Deliverables, not activities
- 8/80 rule — Work packages 8-80 hours

### WBS Structure

```text
1.0 Project Name
├── 1.1 Phase/Deliverable 1
│   ├── 1.1.1 Sub-deliverable
│   │   ├── 1.1.1.1 Work Package
│   │   └── 1.1.1.2 Work Package
│   └── 1.1.2 Sub-deliverable
├── 1.2 Phase/Deliverable 2
└── 1.3 Project Management
    ├── 1.3.1 Planning
    ├── 1.3.2 Monitoring
    └── 1.3.3 Closing
```

### WBS Dictionary Entry

| Field | Content |
| ----- | ------- |
| WBS ID | 1.1.1.1 |
| Name | [Work package name] |
| Description | What's included |
| Owner | Responsible person |
| Effort | Hours estimated |
| Duration | Calendar time |
| Dependencies | Predecessor WBS items |
| Deliverables | Tangible outputs |
| Acceptance Criteria | How to verify complete |

## Schedule Management

### Estimating Techniques

| Technique | When to Use | Accuracy |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **Analogous** | Early estimates, similar projects | ±25-50% |
| **Parametric** | Have historical data | ±10-25% |
| **Three-Point** | Uncertainty exists | Better accuracy |
| **Bottom-Up** | Detailed planning | ±5-10% |

### Three-Point Estimate (PERT)

```text
Expected = (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6

Standard Deviation = (Pessimistic - Optimistic) / 6
```

### Critical Path Method

1. List all activities with durations
2. Identify dependencies
3. Calculate early start/finish (forward pass)
4. Calculate late start/finish (backward pass)
5. Float = Late Start - Early Start
6. Critical Path = Activities with zero float

## Risk Management

### Risk Process

```text
Identify → Analyze → Plan Response → Monitor
    │         │            │            │
    ▼         ▼            ▼            ▼
 Risk     Probability   Strategy     Track &
Register   × Impact     Selection    Update
```

### Risk Register Template

| ID | Risk | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Response | Owner | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ----- | ------ |
| R1 | [Description] | Technical | H/M/L | H/M/L | P×I | [Strategy] | [Name] | Open |

### Risk Response Strategies

| For Threats | For Opportunities |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| **Avoid** — Eliminate cause | **Exploit** — Ensure it happens |
| **Transfer** — Shift to third party | **Share** — Partner for benefit |
| **Mitigate** — Reduce P or I | **Enhance** — Increase P or I |
| **Accept** — Acknowledge, no action | **Accept** — Acknowledge, no action |

### Risk Categories (Sample)

- **Technical** — Technology, complexity, integration
- **External** — Vendors, regulations, market
- **Organizational** — Resources, priorities, politics
- **Project Management** — Estimates, dependencies, scope

## Status Reporting

### Status Report Template

```text
