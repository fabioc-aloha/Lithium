# Study Goals: Lithium Orotate for Cognitive Protection

## Meta-Analysis and Clinical Implementation Framework

---

## Primary Objective

Evaluate the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of low-dose lithium orotate supplementation for cognitive protection in a real-world clinical psychology practice setting, with the goal of expanding to a multi-site observational study.

---

## Phase 1: Pilot Implementation (Single Practice)

### Setting
- Psychology practice (test bed)
- Target population: Patients with subjective cognitive complaints, early MCI indicators, or cognitive aging concerns

### Goals

> ⚠️ **Note**: Lahai Health does not have an internal IRB. An external commercial IRB (Sterling IRB recommended) must be selected. See [IRB-SELECTION-GUIDE.md](../clinical/IRB-SELECTION-GUIDE.md) for details.

| Goal | Metric | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| **G1.1** Establish safety monitoring protocol | Protocol documented and external IRB approved | Month 1-2 |
| **G1.2** Recruit initial cohort | N = 20-30 patients with informed consent | Month 2-4 |
| **G1.3** Baseline cognitive assessment | MoCA, MMSE, or validated cognitive battery | Month 2-4 |
| **G1.4** Implement supplementation protocol | Lithium orotate dosing based on available evidence | Month 4+ |
| **G1.5** Track adherence and tolerability | Weekly/monthly check-ins, side effect logging | Ongoing |
| **G1.6** Collect longitudinal cognitive data | 3-month, 6-month, 12-month assessments | Ongoing |

### Inclusion Criteria (Suggested)
- Age ≥ 50 years
- Subjective memory complaints OR MoCA score 22-26 (mild impairment)
- No current lithium use
- Not on medications with significant lithium interactions
- Adequate kidney function (eGFR > 60)
- Normal thyroid function or stable on replacement

### Exclusion Criteria (Suggested)
- Known kidney disease
- Uncontrolled thyroid condition
- Current use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs (including Losartan), NSAIDs, diuretics
- Pregnancy or planning pregnancy
- Established dementia diagnosis

## Phase 2: Multi-Practitioner Expansion

### Goals

| Goal | Metric | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| **G2.1** Develop standardized protocol manual | Reproducible procedures for other practitioners | After Phase 1 |
| **G2.2** Recruit partner practices | 3-5 additional psychology/psychiatry practices | Year 2 |
| **G2.3** Train practitioners | Standardized training materials | Year 2 |
| **G2.4** Centralize data collection | Secure database with standardized forms | Year 2 |
| **G2.5** Achieve statistical power | N ≥ 100 for meaningful effect detection | Year 2-3 |

### Partner Practice Requirements
- Ability to conduct cognitive assessments
- Willingness to follow standardized protocol
- Patient population with cognitive concerns
- Local ethics/oversight approval

---

## Phase 3: Statistical Validation

### Goals

| Goal | Metric | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| **G3.1** Demonstrate safety | Adverse event rate, kidney/thyroid monitoring | < 5% significant AEs |
| **G3.2** Measure cognitive change | Pre-post cognitive scores | Detect 2-point MoCA change |
| **G3.3** Calculate effect size | Cohen's d or similar | d > 0.3 (small-medium) |
| **G3.4** Establish dose-response | Correlation of dose/duration with outcomes | If detectable |
| **G3.5** Identify responders | Subgroup analysis by baseline characteristics | Exploratory |

### Statistical Considerations

| Parameter | Requirement | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sample size | N ≥ 100 | Power 80% to detect d = 0.3 |
| Control group | Consider waitlist or matched controls | Ethical considerations |
| Blinding | Not possible with supplement | Open-label, acknowledge limitation |
| Follow-up duration | Minimum 6 months, ideally 12+ | Cognitive changes are slow |
| Dropout rate | Anticipate 20-30% | Over-recruit accordingly |

## Outcome Measures

### Primary Outcomes
1. **Cognitive function** (MoCA, MMSE, or computerized battery)
2. **Safety** (adverse events, labs if available)
3. **Adherence** (self-report, pill counts)

### Secondary Outcomes
1. **Subjective memory** (patient-reported scales)
2. **Mood/anxiety** (potential confound or co-benefit)
3. **Quality of life** (if assessed)
4. **Caregiver burden** (if applicable)

### Assessment Schedule

| Timepoint | Assessments |
|-----------|-------------|
| Baseline | Cognitive battery, medical history, labs (if possible) |
| 1 month | Tolerability check, adherence |
| 3 months | Cognitive battery, adverse events |
| 6 months | Cognitive battery, labs (if applicable) |
| 12 months | Cognitive battery, comprehensive review |

---

## Regulatory and Ethical Considerations

### Key Requirements

| Requirement | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Informed consent | Develop comprehensive consent form |
| Voluntary participation | Patients may withdraw at any time |
| Supplement status | Lithium orotate is OTC; clarify this is not FDA-approved for AD |
| Medical oversight | Consider collaboration with physician for monitoring |
| Data protection | HIPAA compliance, secure storage |
| Off-label use disclosure | Patients understand this is investigational |

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Kidney effects | Baseline renal function, periodic monitoring if possible |
| Thyroid effects | Baseline TSH, monitor symptoms |
| Drug interactions | Thorough medication review at baseline |
| Lithium toxicity | Use only low doses; educate patients on signs |
| False hope | Clear communication about experimental nature |

- **Nunes 2013**: Low-dose lithium approach
- **Planned Harvard trial**: Will complement with real-world evidence

### Unique Contribution
- **Real-world setting**: Psychology practice vs. academic center
- **Lithium orotate specifically**: Most published trials used carbonate
- **Practical implementation**: Bridge from research to practice
