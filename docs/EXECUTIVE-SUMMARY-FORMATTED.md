## Abstract

**Background:** A landmark 2025 study published in *Nature* provides compelling evidence that lithium deficiency may contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and that lithium replacement therapy—particularly with lithium orotate—represents a potential prevention and treatment approach.

**Objectives:** To summarize current evidence on lithium for AD prevention and provide clinical guidance for healthcare providers counseling patients on this emerging therapeutic option.

**Methods:** We synthesized findings from the primary *Nature* publication, supporting meta-analyses, epidemiological studies, and randomized controlled trials to develop evidence-based clinical recommendations.

**Results:** Strong evidence supports lithium's neuroprotective mechanisms and the association between brain lithium deficiency and cognitive impairment. Meta-analysis demonstrates statistically significant cognitive benefits. However, optimal dosing, long-term safety of lithium orotate, and translation of preclinical findings to humans remain unclear.

**Conclusions:** While the scientific foundation is promising, clinical trials are needed before lithium orotate can be recommended for dementia prevention. Healthcare providers should acknowledge patient interest while emphasizing the need for ongoing research and appropriate safety monitoring.

## 1. Introduction

A landmark study published in *Nature* in 2025 by Aron and colleagues has generated significant patient and clinical interest in lithium as a potential intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention.^1^ This clinical summary synthesizes the current evidence and provides guidance for healthcare providers counseling patients on this emerging topic.

The key finding—that lithium is the only metal significantly reduced in the brains of individuals with early cognitive impairment—has important implications for our understanding of AD pathogenesis and potential therapeutic approaches.^1^

---

## 2. Summary of Evidence

A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines evaluated seven key hypotheses regarding lithium's neuroprotective effects.^6^

### 2.1 Hypotheses Evaluated

| Hypothesis | Verdict | Confidence |
|------------|---------|------------|
| H1: Lithium demonstrates neuroprotective effects | Verified | High |
| H2: Brain lithium levels are reduced in AD patients | Verified | High |
| H3: Amyloid plaques sequester lithium | Verified | High |
| H4: Lithium orotate is superior to carbonate | Verified (animal) | Moderate |
| H5: Low-dose lithium slows cognitive decline | Verified | Moderate |
| H6: Lithium in drinking water reduces dementia | Verified (epidemiological) | Moderate |
| H7: Lithium compares favorably to FDA-approved AD drugs | Verified | Moderate |

### 2.2 Key Scientific Findings

The following findings emerge from the 2025 *Nature* study and supporting literature:

1. **Lithium is the only metal** significantly reduced in the brains of people with early cognitive impairment^1^
2. **Amyloid plaques sequester lithium**, reducing its availability to healthy brain tissue^1^
3. **Lithium orotate** (not traditional lithium carbonate) can bypass this trapping mechanism^1^
4. In murine models, lithium orotate **reversed memory loss** and **prevented cognitive decline**^1^
5. Population studies demonstrate **17% reduced dementia risk** with higher natural lithium exposure^2^
6. Meta-analysis of 3 RCTs (n=199 analyzed) showed significant cognitive benefits (SMD: −0.41; 95% CI: −0.81 to −0.02; p=0.04)^3^
7. Network meta-analysis: lithium significantly outperformed donanemab, aducanumab, and placebo on MMSE^4^

### 2.3 Contradicting Evidence

A meta-analysis of 8 observational studies (n=377,060) found no significant association between lithium use and dementia risk (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.77-1.24).^7^ This does not negate RCT findings—differences likely reflect variable dosing in naturalistic populations, confounding by indication (bipolar disorder), and use of lithium carbonate rather than orotate.

### 2.4 Evidence Gaps

Critical questions remain unanswered:

| Gap | Clinical Implication |
|-----|---------------------|
| **No human trials of lithium orotate** | The superior formulation is untested in humans |
| Optimal dose for humans | Cannot recommend specific dosing |
| Long-term safety of lithium orotate | Unknown risk profile for this formulation |
| Translation of murine findings | Benefits may not replicate in humans |

---

## 3. Current Recommendations

### 3.1 Expert Opinion

**Dr. Bruce Yankner (Study Author):**
> "Before recommending lithium orotate, we need to determine the effective and safe dose range in people. We are planning a clinical trial of lithium orotate that will hopefully begin in the near future."

### 3.2 Official Position

**Recommendation: Do NOT recommend lithium orotate for dementia prevention at this time.**

Rationale for caution:

| Factor | Concern |
|--------|---------|
| **Dosing unclear** | The ~5mg dose in supplements is arbitrary, not evidence-based |
| **Formulation quality** | Most supplements are not pharmaceutical-grade |
| **Drug interactions** | Lithium interacts with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, diuretics |
| **Monitoring requirements** | Renal and thyroid function require periodic assessment |
| **Regulatory status** | Supplements are unregulated; purity and potency vary |

---

## 4. Comparative Analysis

### 4.1 Lithium vs. FDA-Approved Anti-Amyloid Antibodies

| Factor | Lithium | Lecanemab/Donanemab |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **Annual cost** | ~$100 | ~$26,000–32,000 |
| **Administration** | Oral | IV infusion (biweekly) |
| **Safety profile** | Well-characterized (60+ years) | ARIA risk (brain edema/hemorrhage) |
| **Efficacy** | Comparable or better (meta-analysis)^4^ | FDA approved |
| **Evidence level** | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
| **Infrastructure** | Minimal | PET imaging, infusion centers |

---

## 5. Evidence Confidence Assessment

**Table 1. GRADE-Style Evidence Assessment**

| Claim | Confidence | Evidence Basis |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| Lithium is neuroprotective | **High** | Multiple RCTs + mechanistic studies |
| Low brain lithium linked to AD | **High** | *Nature* 2025 study^1^ |
| Lithium orotate superior to carbonate | **Moderate** | Murine studies only |
| Lithium can prevent dementia | **Moderate** | Epidemiological data + small trials |
| Lithium is ready for clinical use in AD | **Low** | No Phase 3 trials completed |

---

## 6. Clinical Guidance

### 6.1 Counseling Patients Who Ask About Lithium for AD Prevention

A structured approach for patient discussions:

1. **Acknowledge** the promising research foundation
2. **Explain** that clinical trials are required before formal recommendations
3. **Review risks:**
   - Nephrotoxicity (chronic interstitial nephritis, reduced GFR)
   - Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism, goiter)
   - Dehydration sensitivity (lithium toxicity risk)
   - Drug interactions (ARBs, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, thiazides)
4. **Clarify** that lithium carbonate (the form with extensive safety data) may not be the optimal formulation for neuroprotection
5. **If patient chooses to proceed:** Obtain baseline and periodic (q3–6 month) kidney function (eGFR, creatinine) and thyroid function (TSH, free T4)
6. **Document** the shared decision-making conversation

### 6.2 Current Evidence-Based Indications for Lithium

Lithium has established efficacy for:

- Bipolar disorder (FDA approved)
- Suicide prevention (evidence-based)^5^
- Augmentation therapy for treatment-resistant depression

## 7. Ongoing Research

### 7.1 Trials to Monitor

| Study | Institution | Design | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Lithium orotate trial | Harvard (Yankner) | Phase 1/2 | Planning |
| LATTICE | University of Pittsburgh | RCT, n=80, 2 years, 7T MRI, amyloid/tau PET | Results forthcoming |
| Lahai Health Feasibility | Lahai Health (LAHAI-LI-2026-001) | Open-label, n=20-30, 12 months | IRB submission pending |
| Biomarker validation | Multiple | p-tau217 surrogate endpoints | Ongoing |

### 7.2 Proposed Feasibility Study

A community-based feasibility study (Protocol LAHAI-LI-2026-001) is planned to generate first-in-human safety and tolerability data for lithium orotate in adults with subjective cognitive decline or early MCI. Key parameters:

- **Design:** Open-label, single-arm, prospective observational
- **Population:** Adults ≥50 years with SCD or MCI (MoCA 22-26)
- **Intervention:** Lithium orotate 5 mg elemental lithium daily for 12 months
- **Primary outcome:** Feasibility (recruitment, retention, adherence)
- **Key exclusions:** eGFR <60, concurrent ACE inhibitors/ARBs/NSAIDs/diuretics, mixed dementia^8^

### 7.3 Research Priorities

| Priority | Gap | Proposed Approach |
|----------|-----|-------------------|
| Critical | Human PK of lithium orotate | Phase 1 dose-ranging study |
| Critical | Phase 2 efficacy of orotate | Biomarker-endpoint RCT |
| High | Long-term orotate safety | Extended follow-up studies |
| High | Target engagement | Brain lithium MRI spectroscopy |
| Moderate | Primary prevention | Trials in APOE4+ individuals |

### 7.4 Funding Challenges

Lithium orotate is a generic compound without patent protection, making pharmaceutical industry investment unlikely. Public and philanthropic funding will be essential. The *Nature* 2025 study was supported by NIH/NIA and foundations (Ludwig Family Foundation, Glenn Foundation, Aging Mind Foundation).^1^

## 8. Conclusions

The 2025 *Nature* study represents a significant advance in understanding the potential role of lithium in Alzheimer's disease prevention. The evidence supporting lithium's neuroprotective properties is substantial, and the comparative cost-effectiveness versus anti-amyloid antibodies is compelling.

However, without Phase 3 clinical trial data establishing optimal dosing, long-term safety of lithium orotate, and efficacy in human populations, routine clinical use cannot be recommended at this time.

Healthcare providers should:
- Engage in informed discussions with interested patients
- Emphasize the early stage of clinical translation
- Implement appropriate safety monitoring for patients who choose supplementation
- Monitor the literature for emerging trial results
