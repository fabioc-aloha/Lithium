# Principal Investigator Observations

## Overview

This document captures clinical observations and insights from the PI team that inform research design and interpretation.

## Dr. Phillip Cohen, MD

### Background

Dr. Cohen has been educating patients about lithium's neuroprotective potential for years, well before the 2025 Nature publication validated the hypothesis. His direct quote: "The data from Scandinavia about lithium and dementia has been known for years but not acknowledged or adopted."

### Clinical Case: Susan (Spring 2023)

| Factor | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Relationship** | Family member |
| **Initiation** | Spring 2023 |
| **Consultation** | With Susan's psychiatrist |
| **Diagnosis** | Mixed-type dementia (Alzheimer's + vascular) |
| **Intervention** | Lithium (formulation not specified) |
| **Outcome** | No observable benefit |

### Key Insights from Dr. Cohen

1. **Mixed dementia may not respond**
   > "I don't think it helped at all because she has mixed type dementia, Alzheimer's and vascular."

2. **Low doses can be effective**
   > "The doses with the orotate prep are really, really low. That doesn't mean that it can't be effective. We know from other indications that very low dose lithium can be helpful, e.g., in suicide prevention."

3. **Prerequisites for lithium use**
   > "One needs normal kidney and thyroid function to take lithium. As always, consultation with your MDs is important."

4. **Long-standing advocacy**
   Dr. Cohen has been ahead of the curve on lithium's potential for years, predating the mainstream recognition brought by the 2025 Nature study.

## Drug Interaction Concerns

### Losartan (from email thread)

Dr. Cohen's contact Milton raised concern about using lithium with Losartan (an ARB for blood pressure). This is a **valid clinical concern**:

- ARBs can increase lithium levels by 20-30%
- Requires dose adjustment and closer monitoring
- Should be discussed with prescribing physician

### Other Noted Interactions

| Drug Class | Concern |
| --- | --- |
| ACE inhibitors | Increased lithium levels |
| Thiazide diuretics | Reduced lithium clearance |
| NSAIDs | Reduced lithium excretion |

## Implications for Lahai Trial Design

Based on Dr. Cohen's experience:

### Inclusion Criteria Recommendations

1. **Pure Alzheimer's pathology preferred**
   - Exclude or stratify participants with significant vascular component
   - Consider MRI screening for white matter disease

2. **Earlier stage intervention**
   - Target MCI or subjective cognitive decline, not established dementia
   - Prevention may be more effective than treatment

3. **Medication screening**
   - Document all concurrent medications
   - Flag patients on ARBs, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, NSAIDs
   - May require exclusion or enhanced monitoring

### Monitoring Protocol (from Dr. Cohen's recommendations)

| Test | Baseline | Ongoing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kidney function (eGFR, Cr) | Required | Every 6 months |
| Thyroid function (TSH) | Required | Every 6 months |
| Lithium level (if carbonate) | If applicable | As needed |
| Cognitive testing | Required | Every 6 months |
